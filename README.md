# House Price Prediction

This project aims to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a house based on the size of the area, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms. The dataset used for this project is the [Housing Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset?resource=download).
